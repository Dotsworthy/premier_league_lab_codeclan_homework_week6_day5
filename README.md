# Premier League weekend homework for CodeClan Week 6
Based on the following brief:

Your task is to create a front-end JavaScript application that allows users to input items and see them displayed in a list. Choose a theme for the application, such as a list of endangered Animals / favourite Sports Stars / any other theme of your choice. Users should be able to enter values for different properties relating to the theme (Name, Species and Continent, for example) and see them displayed below.

## MVP
- Create a form in HTML with inputs for relevant data
- When the form is submitted, access the data from the form in the form's submit event object
- Create a list in HTML
- Append the submitted data to the list
- Add a "Delete All" <button> which clears all of the list items from the list

Note: If you are at all unclear about the process of reading and writing to the DOM, complete the MVP, writing all the code in one function. Understanding the document's methods is the main learning for this homework. Abstracting code into helper functions is secondary.
